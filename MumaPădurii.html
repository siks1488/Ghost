    <h1>Muma Pădurii</h1>
    <p>In Romanian folklore, Muma Pădurii (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈmuma pəˈdurij]) is an ugly and mischievous or mad old woman living in the forest (in the <br> heart of virgin forests, in a hut/cabin, or an old tree). She is the opposite of fairies such as Zână. She is also the protector of the animals and plants,<br> brewing potions and helping injured animals. She cures the forest if it is dying and she keeps unwanted trespassers away by driving them mad and<br> scaring them.<br><br>

        She can be associated with witches (like the witch from the story of "Hansel and Gretel"), but she is a neutral "creature", harming<br> only those who harm the forest.</p><br>
    <h1>Etymology</h1>
    <p>Muma Pădurii literally means "mother of the forest", though "mumă" is an archaic version of "mamă" (mother), which has a fairy tale overtone for the <br>Romanian reader (somewhat analogous to using the archaic pronouns like "thou" and "thy" in English). A few other words, typically protagonists of <br>folktales, have this effect.</p><br>
    <h1>Characteristics</h1>
    <p>Muma Pădurii is a spirit of the forest in a very ugly and old woman's body. Sometimes she has the ability to change her shape. She lives in a dark,<br> dreadful, hidden little house.<br><br>

        She is thought to attack children and because of this a large variety of spells (descântece in Romanian) are used against her.<br><br>
        
        This (step-) mother of the forest kidnaps little children and enslaves them. In one popular story, at some point, she tries to boil a little girl alive in a soup.<br> However the little girl's brother outsmarts Muma Pădurii and pushes the woman-monster in the oven instead, similar to the story of Hansel and Gretel.<br> The story ends on a happy note when all kids are free to go back to their parents.</p><br><br>
