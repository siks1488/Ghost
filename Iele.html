    <h1>Iele</h1>
    <p>The iele are feminine mythical creatures in Romanian mythology. There are several differing descriptions of their characteristics. Often they are <br>described as faeries (z√¢ne in Romanian), with great seductive power over men, with magic skills and attributes similar to nymphs, naiads and dryads <br>found in Greek mythology.</p><br>
    <h1>Locations</h1>
    <p>The iele are said to live in the sky, in forests, in caves and on isolated mountain cliffs, and reported to have been seen bathing in the springs or at<br> crossroads. From this point of view, the Iele are similar to the Ancient Greek Hecate, a three headed goddess of Thracian origin, who guards crossroads.</p><br>
    <h1>Activities</h1>
    <p>They mostly appear at night by moonlight, as dancing Horas, in secluded areas such as glades, the tops of certain trees (maples, walnut trees), ponds,<br> river sides, crossroads or abandoned fireplaces, dancing naked, with their breasts almost covered by their disheveled hair, with bells on their ankles and<br> carrying candles. In almost all of these instances, the Iele appear to be incorporeal. Rarely, they are dressed in chain mail coats. The effect of their<br> specific dance, the Hora is similar to the dances of the Bacchantes.</p>
